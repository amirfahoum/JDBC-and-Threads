===========================================
 we will build a simple web crawler that scans URLs of images
about class:
we creat 3 class , 
Crawl
myrunnable
Taskstatus
crawl  the main class ,
in crawl we read the 5 parameters that the user obtain by args() , that are  thread num ,delay, ret and ,num retries , and finall the name of the doc that we should read the urls from
after we store that data in array list  <taskstatus > ,
we creat object from Task status for every url we have in the file , after we store and creat object of task status . that contain url .
we creat the threads  and execute it .
the thread run run function and start the connection to the url . after he connected we goe to the my runnable class where we check the http if it contain an image if yes then we update the bool member in Task status .
if we failed to reach the web then we try until number of tries that the user entered . every thread make sleep time every time he get the content type.
in my runnable class we calculate the time that it takes to web to reach the web . and enter in to time member that in taskstatus 
in the task status we save the data of every Task .
it Have  4 members
  private boolean isImage = false;
    private double time = 0;
    long  id=-1;
    private String url;
===============================================
About db 
every URl that contain an image will be saved on the db , we insert the id of the thried and the time and the url to that data base , 
the inserting happens at crawl class at the end of the code 
if the url contain image then we connect to the server and give some commands to inser the data to the database  
at the end the program will print the details that i mentioned before in the console  and update the data table.

===============================================
some Points
if the geturl (url  member) equal to 0 in Task status then it means that "timeout"
if  get url is equal to -1 then it means the failed to connect to web .

that data base that i creat to check it was called ex2 and contain an table that called image , so if you see in the path  of the connection to db this line
/localhost:3306/ex2?user
called the db ex2.
 * we used intellij to write the code with java lan..
 *for database we used mySql and Xamp development environment// package includes the Apache web server,
